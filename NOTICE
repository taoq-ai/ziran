  Specifically, refusal detection strings in
  koan/application/detectors/refusal.py were adapted from:
    - garak/detectors/mitigation.py  (MitigationBypass detector)
    - garak/detectors/base.py         (StringDetector / REJECTION_STRINGS)

  The matchtype parameter pattern and inversion detection strategy
  were inspired by garak's detector architecture.
